A Java library and Play Framework web app for generating four-part harmony
=================================
This is a complete Play Framework web application, including a frontend, that exposes an online service for generating four part harmonic chorales. You can use the actual chorale-generating part in `/app/harmony` as a library to generate harmony independently, or as part of a java application. You can also play with a [live demo](https://woodstock-server.herokuapp.com/) (give it a second to start up; it's a free Heroku instance).

This supports most of the rules of four-part harmony, including chromatic chords like aug-6 and the neapolitan. The project is stable, and basically fully functional.

I'm currently working on an even more powerful solution, a music domain specific language, so development on this project has stopped.
